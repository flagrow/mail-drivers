                Clicking "set the mail driver to ..." will update your current "driver" setting from the Email tab.
                You can go back to the SMTP driver by setting "driver" to "smtp" in the Email tab of the admin panel.
                Disabling this extension won't automatically switch you back to SMTP !

                    This field is just for convenience and is synced with the same field from the Email tab.
                    Make sure this email address is allowed to send messages via the driver you're using.
